sic is an image crate[1], CLI front-end. It allows you to manipulate images using image operations and convert images between various formats. Both static and animated images are supported.

Formats
-------

sic can decode the following image formats:
* AVIF, BMP, GIF, DDS, Farbfeld, ICO, JPEG, OpenExr, PNG, PAM, PBM, PGM, PPM, TGA, TIFF and WebP

sic can encode images into the following formats:
* AVIF, BMP, Farbfeld, GIF, ICO, JPEG, OpenExr, PNG, PNM (PAM, PBM, PGM and PPM), QOI TGA, TIFF and WebP.

Batch processing
----------------

By default, sic's input and output arguments expect a single input and output image.
You may however replace --input and --output by respectively --glob-input and --glob-output to batch process images matching the glob pattern given to --glob-input.
You may need to provide quotation marks around the pattern, so your shell will not superfluously expand it.
The --glob-output argument expects an output folder instead of a file path, and the file structure from the first common folder of
the matching input image paths will be mirrored to the output directory.

A thank you and request
-----------------------

We would like to explicitly state that the sic authors are not affiliated with the image crate authors.
We do like to thank them for creating and maintaining an amazing set of libraries however!
